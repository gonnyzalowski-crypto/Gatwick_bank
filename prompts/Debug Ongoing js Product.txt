Prompt 1 — Technical assessment (paste exactly)

You are a senior technical advisor. Produce a concise, systematic technical assessment of our fintech app and return the result inside <app_review> tags.

Deliverables:
- Inventory of non-functional / miswired buttons (by screen/component).
- End-to-end logical flows validated or broken (onboarding→KYC→funding→trading→settlement).
- Feature completeness checklist (trading, deposits, withdrawals, admin, reporting).
- Integration & interaction gaps (API contract mismatches, webhooks, idempotency, caching, event propagation).
- Immediate critical risks that require a hotfix (security, money-moving, RBAC, reconciliation).

Context: stack = JavaScript/TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, Railway (auto-deploy). Available MCPs: Playwright, filesystem, agentic coding, Magic UI. Keep output factual, prioritized, and minimal.

Prompt 2 — Detailed remediation per issue (paste exactly)

You are a senior technical advisor. For every issue found in Prompt 1, produce structured remediation entries and return inside <app_review> tags.

For each issue include:
1. Short title (1 line).
2. Precise problem description (2–3 sentences).
3. Likely root cause(s).
4. Concrete test plan to reproduce and validate fixes (commands, test data, Playwright steps).
5. Step-by-step remediation (code-level where relevant), including:
   - Client changes (TS types, API client, button handling, optimistic UI).
   - Server changes (idempotency, transactions, audit log schema, webhook retry).
   - DB/schema changes (fields, indexes).
   - CI gating and Railway-safe deployment rules.
6. Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and estimated dev complexity (Small/Medium/Large).
7. Example code snippets or shell commands in TypeScript/Node where applicable.

Require pragmatic, implementable steps — no high-level theory. Include at least one quick, urgent hotfix script or code diff for a common button bug (TSX).

Prompt 3 — Testing, CI/CD, UAT & encouragement (paste exactly)

You are a senior technical advisor. Deliver a compact, executable testing and deployment strategy and return inside <app_review> tags.

Required outputs:
- Exhaustive test-case matrix covering all user scenarios (auth, onboarding/KYC, deposit (QR/webhook/reconcile), withdraw, trading, admin).
- Unit test plan per module (frontend components, backend services) and recommended tools (Vitest/Jest, Playwright, Pact).
- Integration & contract testing approach (mock gateways, Pact, schema assertions).
- Playwright E2E plan with three critical scripts (deposit flow, trade lifecycle, admin address rotation) and example test steps.
- CI/CD pipeline required checks before Railway auto-deploy (TS compile, ESLint, unit tests, contract tests, Playwright smoke) and fail/rollback policy.
- UAT checklist and synthetic monitoring (canary tests every 5–15m).
- Short motivational closing paragraph (2–3 lines) stressing importance of tests and measurable reliability gains.

Be concise, tool-specific, and actionable. Include exact test commands and CI job names to add to pipeline.
