i have shortened the md. you dont need to use sequentioal thinking, i have realised that whenever we use sequential think, it gets stuck on processing and deliverimg resposnse

as soon as a user registers it is automatically reflected here and creates the back codes for the user to use.

now for all the feature is development in the admin, creaye their routes integrate with user dashboard, linkk properly, make sure api works perfect and fast. the response on this project is quite slow, 

we have used playwright to determine these before, find the md and do them.

ask questions, use filesystem mcp to understand, use sequential thinking to create forward routesa and pages. dont freeze along the way. create the front end in user end for these, and connect the routes properly
